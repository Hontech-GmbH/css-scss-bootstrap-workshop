<h3>03 - Media Query Mixins</h3>
<p>
  Go back to exercise <i>01 - Responsive Media Query Layout</i><br/>
  Create Mixins for the responsive breakpoints and name them accordingly. e.g. <code>for-s-screens, for-m-screens, for-l-screens, for-xl-screens</code>.<br/>
  Apply the mixins instead of using the media queries directly. This ensures better reusability in case the breakpoint sizes will change in the future.
